# Quickstart: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Module

**Feature**: 007-vla-module
**Date**: 2025-12-30

## Overview

This module covers Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems for robotics, focusing on the convergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and robotics, and how to translate human language into robot actions for end-to-end autonomous humanoid behavior.

## Module Structure

The Vision-Language-Action module consists of three chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: Voice-to-Action (Whisper)** - Understanding voice processing and natural language interfaces for robots
2. **Chapter 2: LLM-Based Cognitive Planning** - Implementing AI reasoning for robotic task planning
3. **Chapter 3: Capstone – Autonomous Humanoid** - Complete integration of VLA systems for autonomous behavior

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with LLMs and AI systems
- Understanding of Docusaurus documentation structure

### Reading Path
1. Start with Chapter 1 to understand voice-to-action processing
2. Proceed to Chapter 2 to learn about cognitive planning
3. Complete with Chapter 3 to understand complete VLA system integration

## Key Concepts

### Voice-to-Action
- Speech recognition and processing
- Natural language understanding
- Command interpretation
- Action mapping

### LLM-Based Planning
- Cognitive reasoning for robotics
- Task decomposition
- Goal-oriented planning
- Context awareness

### Autonomous Humanoid
- End-to-end system integration
- Multi-component coordination
- Real-time decision making

## Integration Points

This module integrates with:
- Previous modules on robotics concepts
- The overall Docusaurus documentation structure
- VLA and robotics ecosystem tools and frameworks

## Next Steps

After completing this module, you should be able to:
- Explain VLA pipelines and their components
- Describe the language-to-action flow in robotics
- Understand end-to-end autonomous systems
- Design VLA systems for humanoid robots
